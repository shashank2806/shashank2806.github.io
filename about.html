  <p>I am a junior year computer science student. I am in awe of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I am always
     learning something about this field. I enjoy experimenting with Machine Learning and Deep Learning techinques and apply it
      to different areas. I am also interested in Data Science and love when data throws some mind-boggling insights.

    I'm always looking for opportunities to work on exciting projects. I'm currently open to part-time and full-time positions,
    as well as contract work. Let's make something great, together.
